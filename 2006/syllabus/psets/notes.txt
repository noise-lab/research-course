- novelty: has the work been placed in context with previous work?              
- potential impact/technical merit                                              
- clarity/presentation, etc.                                                    
                                                                                
also rate expertise level in the *general* area (example of a general area is   
"networking").                                                                  
                                                                                
detailed comments ...                                                           
                                                                                
attach reference for how write a review.                                        
                                                                                
as in a conference, you won't be expert in all areas.  you should just be       
aware of your expertise and do the review to the best of your ability.  a good  
reviewer will often go beyond reading the actual paper itself and get familiar  
with the topic and the general area.
