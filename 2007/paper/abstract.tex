This paper describes a course we have developed for preparing new Ph.D.
students in computer science for a career in research.  The course is
intended to teach the skills needed for research and independent work,
prepare students psychologically and socially for years lying before
them, and help them find a good Ph.D. topic by providing principles and
examples.  In this course, we emphasize and encourage impact through
cross-disciplinary research and broader societal outreach.  To our
knowledge, the course represents a first-of-its-kind systematic
introduction to a graduate research career.  This paper describes our
high-level goals for this curricular initiative, the structure of the
course (including lecture components and assignments), and the
challenges we faced in developing this course.  As we continue to
develop this course, which is now in its second year, we hope it will
serve as a model ``introduction of Ph.D. research'' course for other
computer science departments.
