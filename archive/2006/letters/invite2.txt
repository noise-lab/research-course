Hi @INVITE@,

Alex Gray and I are organizing CS 7001 this year, and we would like to
bring faculty members in to talk under one of two general topic areas:

(1) research skills and philosophy (e.g., how to select a problem, good
ideas vs. bad ideas, theory vs. practice, etc.)

(2) "big ideas" or open problems (e.g., What's wrong with the Internet?)

We would like to invite you to come in and talk about @TOPIC@, although
we are generally receptive to having you speak about anything you want.
Your talk can be as short as 20 minutes or as long as one hour.

Please see:
http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2007/cs7001_fall/syllabus.html#Schedule
for available dates.  As you can see, most dates are presently open.  The
class meets on Mondays and Wednesdays (and, if you prefer, Fridays) from
10-11am in Boggs B6A.  

We really hope you will come speak to the class.  Giving a CS 7001 lecture
is not only a great service to the new PhD students, but we will also
advertise these lectures to the whole department.

We very much hope that you will be able to come give us a lecture.  What do
you think?  

Thanks,
Nick Feamster
Alex Gray
