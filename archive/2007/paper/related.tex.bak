\section{Related Work}\label{sec:related}

There are a number of works treating or touching upon various elements
of the course, both general and
specific~\cite{phd-not-enough,reshaping-grad-educ,grad-school-survival,
  unwritten-rules,art-sci-investigation,creativity-in-science,res-students-guide}.
For the elements of the course which are not specific to the Ph.D., such
as aspects of time management, there are many popular works.  A number
of works have touched upon the educational side of cross-disciplinary
research~\cite{work-at-boundaries,facilitating-interdisc,
  grand-unif-interdisc,discourse-anal-cross-disc}.  Many
interdisciplinary PhD training initiatives exist for specific topics,
such as mathematical biology, rather than for Computer Science with any
external discipine, or for any discipline in general.  To our knowledge
there exists no other computer science Ph.D. preparation course similar
to ours, which integrates all of the above elements into a single
coherent framework.
