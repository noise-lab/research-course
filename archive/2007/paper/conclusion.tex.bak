\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

hile much of the information we present in this course is available
in books and on various websites created by students and various
Ph.D.-holding individuals who have taken interest in certain subsets of
this topic, no single unified and coherent source seems to exist, no
less a structured course.  Our course appears to be the first
programmatic attempt to give students all the unwritten rules for
performing great research and having successful careers in research.
Also, our emphasis on cross-disciplinary work and broader impact
brings these topics stemming from important current trends in science
and society into students' purview at as early a stage as possible.  We
believe these are transformative viewpoints to which students might not
otherwise be exposed at all.

Going further, we believe this course has the potential to form the
cornerstone for a cross-disciplinary Ph.D. program.  We are working on a
graduate version of the Threads initiative which extends the ideas in
this course across the entire Ph.D. career.
