@INVITE@,

Alex Gray and I are organizing CS 7001 this year, and we would like to
bring faculty members in to talk under one of two general topic areas:

(1) research skills and philosophy (e.g., how to select a problem, what
    research result you are most proud of, theory vs. practice, etc.)

(2) "big ideas" (e.g., What's wrong with the Internet?)

We would like to invite you to come in and talk about @TOPIC@, although we
are generally receptive to having you speak about anything you want.

Please see:
http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2007/cs7001_fall/syllabus.html#Schedule
for available dates.  As you can see, most dates are presently open.

We really hope you will come speak to the class.  Giving a CS 7001
lecture is not only a great service to the department, but also a very
scalable way to introduce yourself to the department.

The class meets on Mondays and Wednesdays (and, if you prefer, Fridays)
from 10-11am in Boggs B6A.  We very much hope that you will be able to
come give us a lecture.

Thanks,
Nick Feamster
Alex Gray
