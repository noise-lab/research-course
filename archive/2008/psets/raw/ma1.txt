@PURPOSE@

The purpose of this assignment is to encourage you to write down your
current goals for getting a Ph.D.  Putting your thoughts down on paper
will help you think clearly about the ``big picture'' reasons that you
are here.  During the course of graduate school, you may want to revist
these ``macro'' goals to see whether you are making progress towards
achieving them.

@TASK@

Write a response to the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep=-1pt
    \item Why are you doing the Ph.D.? (1-2 paragraphs)
    \item What research/researchers do you strive to emulate?
    \item What research result(s) do you most admire?
\end{itemize}
\noindent
If this is your first exposure to research, you may have a difficult
time answering the latter questions, but now is a very good time to
start seeking out examples of research (and researchers) that you
value.  This process will begin the process of developing
research ``taste'' which you will continue to refine throughout your
research career.
