## Exercises

We have created several \"problem set\" exercises to help students
develop experience with both creative thinking and the logistics of the
Ph.D.

*Assignments.* We have created three assignments concerning the
generation and evaluation of ideas:

-   [Recognizing good ideas](exercises/recognizing.md)
-   [Creating ideas](exercises/creating.md)
-   [Applying ideas](exercises/applying.md)
-   [Critiquing ideas](exercises/critiquing.md)

*Mini-Assignments.* To help students with more practical issues
concerning the Ph.D., we have also designed four mini assignments:

-   [Why Ph.D.?](exercises/why-phd.md)
-   [Time Log](exercises/time.md)
-   [Research Web Page](exercises/webpage.md)
-   [Multi-Resolution Elevator Pitch](exercises/elevator.md)

*Mini-Project.* To help you get your feet wet with research as soon as
possible, to expose you to research in other disciplines, and to give
you an excuse to meet faculty other than your advisor, we have created a
[mini-project assignment](exercises/mini-project.md).
 We ask that you complete two mini-projects by the end of the term.

*Project.* To provide you practice with reading and writing presentation
skills, to give you a deadline to work towards, and to help you begin to
iterate on your thoughts as part of the research project, we have
created a [main project assignment](exercises/main-project.md).
 This assignment assumes that you are already paired with at least a
temporary research advisor.

These assignments were designed jointly by Nick Feamster and Alex Gray
and have undergone several iterations over the years.
