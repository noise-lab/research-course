## Background

This project started in Fall 2006, when the two of us were asked to
prepare a course for incoming Ph.D. students at Georgia Tech to help
them become exposed to research methods early in their career.  After
agreeing to take on the preparation of this new course, we quickly
discovered that, while there is a wealth of knowledge about research
techniques and methods, and many thoughts on skills for creative and
critical thinking, this material had not been aggregated or distilled
into a single document or course.  We spent the next five years
developing a course at Georgia Tech, \"CS 7001: Introduction to Graduate
Studies\", refining the concepts, methods, and assignments each year.

On this site, we will codify the modules from the
course.  We have also made our course notes available on this site, for
the benefit of both other Ph.D. students and for faculty at other
universities who may choose to use this course as a model for similar
courses at their institutions.

We created this site in Fall 2013 to add blog post material
to the course content that already existed, to make the research advice
and course exercises digestible for a broader audience.

We are working on adding all of the content to this site.  Meanwhile,
please also feel free to peruse some of the previous course offerings
(e.g., [2008](http://www.noise-lab.net/classes/cs7001/fall_2008/syllabus.html#Schedule "2008"), 
[2009](http://www.noise-lab.net/classes/cs7001/fall_2009/syllabus.html#Schedule "2009")).

We will welcome feedback on the material as we post it.

Thanks!

**Note:** Both Nick and Alex have left Georgia Tech, so this course is
no longer offered at Georgia Tech in its current form. We will continue
to maintain the blog as a space for posting research advice.  We welcome
guest posts!
