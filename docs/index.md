## How to Do Great Research

We (Professors [Nick Feamster](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~feamster/ "Nick
Feamster") and [Alex Gray](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-gray-b554b64/))
created a course as a resource for advice on research and creativity methods
and techniques for Ph.D. students. We originally created the material as part
of a course offering at Georgia Tech (read on for the history).  

The intended audience for this site is Ph.D.  students in computer science
programs, but many of the concepts that we present on this site may also apply
to other disciplines.

### Blog

Much of this material in this course is available in article format on my
[Great Research](https://medium.com/great-research) blog.

### Syllabus

We have designed this material to fit into a one-term course. Here is a
[schedule](syllabus.md) for how a course can organize topics, readings, and
the assignments below.

### Skills

The material we have provided will prepare you to perform great
research in computer science, regardless of the area you ultimately choose to
pursue for your Ph.D. The material should:

- Teach you many skills that you will keep in your \"research
  toolbox\" for the rest of your career. Each of these linked topics below
  includes a slide deck that could be used as part of a lecture.
    - understanding the goals of a Ph.D. <a href="slides/phd-why.ppt">[ppt]</a>
    - [time management](slides/time-management.ppt)
    - [productivity and (selective) procrastination](slides/motivation-and-procrastination.ppt)
    - [how to read a research paper](slides/reading-reviewing.ppt)
    - [how to review a research paper](slides/reading-reviewing.ppt)
    - [how to write a research paper (technical writing)](slides/how-to-write.ppt)
    - [understanding patterns in research ideas](slides/research-patterns.ppt)
    - [how to generate ideas, creativity, sources of problems](slides/creativity.ppt)
    - [people skills](slides/people-skills.ppt)
    - [how to give a good talk](slides/how-to-give-a-talk.ppt)
    - [how to think about jobs](slides/research-jobs.ppt)
    - how to write a proposal
    - how to be a good TA
- Find some inspiration regarding open problems and big ideas
- Offer general tips for life in graduate school and beyond

### Exercises

As part of the course we created, we developed several [exercises](exercises.md)
to complete to help better develop your research toolbox:
   - [Recognizing good ideas](exercises/recognizing.md)
   - [Creating research ideas](exercises/creating.md)
   - [Applying research ideas across disciplines](exercises/applying.md)
   - [Critiquing and evaluating research ideas](exercises/critiquing.md)

We also have developed several mini-exercises that should be practically
useful for many Ph.D. students:
   - [Why a Ph.D.?](exercises/why-phd.md)
   - [Managing time](exercises/time.md)
   - [Creating a research web page](exercises/webpage.md)
   - [Developing an elevator pitch](exercises/elevator.md)


### Projects

The course also has two projects:
   - [Mini-Project](exercises/mini-project.md): This project allows a student to meet and experiment
     working with different faculty members in the department.
   - [Main Project](exercises/main-project.md): This project allows a student to work on a research
     problem with a faculty member in the department with the goal of
     developing a path towards a publishable research paper.

### Background

The material that we have provided on this site is based on a class that was
designed by Professors Nick Feamster and Alex Gray from Fall 2006 through Fall
2010 at Georgia Tech.

We have learned a lot from these course offerings.  We have distilled
many of our insights and lessons from teaching this course in an [ACM
SIGCSE paper](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1352135.1352294 "Can Great Research Be Taught?").  

Various aspects of this course have been used and replicated at universities
around the world.  We have made the material from the course available to
others for the benefit of both computer science Ph.D. students and others who
might wish to teach a similar course.
