## How to Do Great Research

We (Professors [Nick Feamster](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~feamster/ "Nick
Feamster") and [Alexander Gray](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~agray/ "Alex Gray"))
created a course as a resource for advice on research and creativity methods
and techniques for Ph.D. students. We originally created the material as part
of a course offering at Georgia Tech (read on for the history).  The intended
audience for this site is Ph.D.  students in computer science programs, but
many of the concepts that we present on this site may also apply to other
disciplines.

**Skills** The material we have provided will prepare you to perform great
research in computer science, regardless of the area you ultimately choose to
pursue for your Ph.D. The material should:

- Teach you many skills that you will keep in your \"research
  toolbox\" for the rest of your career:
    - time management
    - productivity and (selective) procrastination
    - how to read a research paper
    - how to review a research paper
    - how to write a research paper (technical writing)
    - how to generate ideas, creativity, sources of problems
    - information management (research notebooks, etc.)
    - how to give a good talk
    - how to write a proposal
    - how to be a good TA
- Find some inspiration regarding open problems and big ideas
- Offer general tips for life in graduate school and beyond

**Exercises** As part of the course we created, we developed several exercises
to complete to help better develop your research toolbox:
   - [Why a Ph.D.?](exercises/why-phd.md)
   - [Recognizing good ideas](exercises/recognizing.md)
   - [Creating research ideas](exercises/creating.md)
   - [Applying research ideas across disciplines](exercises/applying.md)
   - [Critiquing and evaluating research ideas](exercises/critiquing.md)
   - [Managing time](exercises/time.md)
   - [Creating a research web page](exercises/webpage.md)
   - [Developing an elevator pitch](exercises/elevator.md)

**History and Background.** The material that we have provided on this
site is based on a class that was designed by Professors Nick Feamster
and Alex Gray from Fall 2006 through Fall 2010 at Georgia Tech.

This project started in Fall 2006, when the two of us were asked to
prepare a course for incoming Ph.D. students at Georgia Tech to help
them become exposed to research methods early in their career.  After
agreeing to take on the preparation of this new course, we quickly
discovered that, while there is a wealth of knowledge about research
techniques and methods, and many thoughts on skills for creative and
critical thinking, this material had not been aggregated or distilled
into a single document or course.  We spent the next five years
developing a course at Georgia Tech, \"CS 7001: Introduction to Graduate
Studies\", refining the concepts, methods, and assignments each year.

We have learned a lot from these course offerings.  We have distilled
many of our insights and lessons from teaching this course in a an [ACM
SIGCSE paper](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1352135.1352294 "Can Great Research Be Taught?").  

On this site, we will codify the modules from the
course.  We have also made our course notes available on this site, for
the benefit of both other Ph.D. students and for faculty at other
universities who may choose to use this course as a model for similar
courses at their institutions.

Various aspects of this course have been replicated at other
universities.  We have made the material from the course available to
others for the benefit of both computer science Ph.D. students and
others who might wish to teach a similar course.

Nick and Alex created this site in Fall 2013 to add blog post material
to the course content that already existed, to make the research advice
and course exercises digestible for a broader audience.

We are working on adding all of the content to this site.  Meanwhile,
please also feel free to peruse some of the previous course offerings
(e.g., [2008](http://www.noise-lab.net/classes/cs7001/fall_2008/syllabus.html#Schedule "2008"), 
[2009](http://www.noise-lab.net/classes/cs7001/fall_2009/syllabus.html#Schedule "2009")).

We will welcome feedback on the material as we post it.

Thanks!

**Note:** Both Nick and Alex have left Georgia Tech, so this course is
no longer offered at Georgia Tech in its current form. We will continue
to maintain the blog as a space for posting research advice.  We welcome
guest posts!
