 **Mini-Conference**

 

**We are in the process of preparing the lecture notes for public
release.**  As we release the notes for each lecture, we will also post
a brief article** **to accompany the slides.  In the future, we will
prepare a video for each lecture topic, as well.  We encourage you to
work through the material on this site independently, and to post
comments and thoughts to the articles and postings on the site.  We will
periodically also update the site with blog posts.  Although many of the
blog posts linked in the syllabus are from previous years, we intend to
continue posting blog entries this year on new topics related to the
Ph.D., and research in general.  Please follow along!

## Online Discussion

This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is
highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates,
the TA, and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching
staff, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. If you have any
problems or feedback for the developers, email team@piazza.com.

Find our class page on Piazza, where online discussions will be held.
