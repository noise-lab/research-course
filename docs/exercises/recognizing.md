## Recognizing Good Ideas

**1 Purpose of this Assignment**

This assignment is the first in a series of assignments where you will
take the steps needed to do great research. In this assignment, you will
perform one of the most common tasks that we as researchers perform to
find a research problem: you will read the most recent proceedings from
the top conference in your area, select two papers that you think
represent "good research", and present one idea (for each paper) on how
to extend that research (sometimes hints are presented in the papers
themselves!).

**2 Problem**

One of the first tasks that a researcher must do---not to mention one of
the most challenging ones---is finding the right problem or problems to
work on. What makes a great research problem?

First, it's important to realize that there's not necessarily a "right"
answer to this question, and that research is often a matter of taste.
Second, it's often difficult to tell whether a research problem is truly
great at first cut (see today's reading for examples where reviewers
"got it wrong" the first time around).

Nevertheless, while there are no hard and fast criteria, great research
problems tend to share many of the following characteristics. Here are
some of our thoughts on what makes good research; when perusing
conference proceedings, it may help you to keep some of the following
criteria in mind when selecting papers:

• *The problem is difficult.* Life is too short to solve easy problems.

• *Solving the problem creates new knowledge.* Recognizing the
difference between research and "a simple matter of engineering" is
important. Many problems are difficult, but if an army of programmers
could solve the problem with what we know today, it's probably not
research.

• *The problem changes conventional thinking.* While there is value in
confirming conventional wisdom, great research typically offers
surprising results, creates a new way of thinking about or approaching
problems.

• *The problem has a solution.* Not every paper needs to solve a problem
completely (in fact, you'll go looking for future work as part of this
assignment). Still, while posing a good question is paramount, the
solution or finding presented in a paper should represent a significant
advance beyond the previous body of knowledge. As a Ph.D. student, since
you ultimately need to graduate, it's good to pick problems that have
some solution!

Needless to say, it's difficult when first starting out on a problem do
determine whether it has these characteristics, but it is often patently
clear when a problem does not have them.

**3 Task**

*Read conference proceedings.* Each research group should select two
papers from their respec- tive conference proceedings. Please use the
following conference proceedings as references:

• *Architecture:* International Conference on Architectural Support for
Programming Languages and Operating Systems (ASPLOS)\
• *Artificial Intelligence:* International Joint Conference on
Artificial Intelligence\
• *Cognitive Science:* Cognitive Science Society Annual Meeting
(CogSci)\
• *Computational Science and Engineering:* SIAM Annual Meeting\
• *Cryptography:* CRYPTO\
• *Databases:* ACM SIGMOD/PODS\
• *Graphics:* ACM SIGGRAPH\
• *HCI:* CHI\
• *Learning Science and Technology:* International Conference of the
Learning Sciences,\
• *Machine Learning:* Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS)\
• *Networking:* Proceedings of ACM SIGCOMM\
• *Programming Languages:* ACM Programming Language Design and
Implementation\
• *Robotics:* Robotics Science and Systems\
• *Security:* IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy\
• *Software Engineering:* ACM SIGSOFT Symposium on the Foundations of
Software Engineering (FSE)\
• *Systems:* ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles\
• *Theory:* ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing\
• *Vision:* Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)

Select and defend papers. After selecting your two papers, write a
one-page summary of each paper that provides (1) A short summary of the
paper; (2) Why you think it satisfies the criteria for good research;
(3) A short problem statement for a possible follow-on research problem.
 Use the criteria of novelty, impact, and clarity to defend your
selection, as well as the questions from the [post on cultivating
research taste](http://greatresearch.org/2013/09/13/cultivating-your-research-taste/ "Cultivating Your Research Taste")
